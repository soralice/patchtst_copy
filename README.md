# PatchTST

PatchTST: "A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers." (official repo: https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST)

**Updates**: 

2023-01: Our paper was accepted to ICLR 2023! The new official repo is: https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST.

Nov 29th: update few instructions and include other baseline models in supervised learning for comparison.

Nov 16th: initial repo created.

## Key Designs

1. **Patching**: segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer.

2. **Channel-independence**: each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series.

## Getting Started

We seperate our codes for supervised learning and self-supervised learning into 2 folders: ```PatchTST_supervised``` and ```PatchTST_self_supervised```. Please choose the one that you want to work with.

### Supervised Learning

1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Download data. You can download all the datasets from [Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy). Create a seperate folder ```./dataset``` and put all the csv files in the directory.

3. Training. All the scripts are in the directory ```./scripts/PatchTST```. The default model is PatchTST/42. For example, if you want to get the multivariate forecasting results for weather dataset, just run the following command, and you can open ```./result.txt``` to see the results once the training is done:
```
sh ./scripts/PatchTST/weather.sh
```

You can adjust the hyperparameters based on your needs (e.g. different patch length, different look-back windows and prediction lengths.). We also provide codes for the baseline models.

### Self-supervised Learning

1. Follow the first 2 steps above

2. Pre-training: The scirpt patchtst_pretrain.py is to train the PatchTST/64. To run the code with a single GPU on ettm1, just run the following command
```
python patchtst_pretrain.py --dset ettm1 --mask_ratio 0.4
```
The model will be saved to the saved_model folder for the downstream tasks. There are several other parameters can be set in the patchtst_pretrain.py script.
 
 3. Fine-tuning: The script patchtst_finetune.py is for fine-tuning step. Either linear_probing or fine-tune the entire network can be applied.
```
python patchtst_finetune.py --dset ettm1 --pretrained_model <model_name>
```
